> This program is an interpreter of maze images (that fit the adequate format) and navigates through the maze from start to finish with the shortest path. This maze solver is an object orientated program that utilizes OpenCV to read images, solve the maze with a depth first search algorithm, and output the path in a command-line interface. This project was built with CMake. Instructions are provided on how to solve your own mazes.
